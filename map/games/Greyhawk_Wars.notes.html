			Greyhawk Wars for TripleA is an immersive strategy game based on the World of Greyhawk, the classic setting of Dungeons & Dragons.
			<br>
			<br>Inspired by an out-of-print tabletop wargame and built on the TripleA engine, Greyhawk Wars offers world-spanning conflict, diverse factions, and flexible opportunities for conquest and diplomacy.
			<br>
			<br>Central to the game are the individual personalities who lead each faction, recruiting mercenaries and seeking magical artifacts to tilt the balance of power in their favor.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h1>2. Gameplay</h1>
			Greyhaw Wars centers around each faction's leader and hero units, which recruit new armies, lead them in battle, hire mercenaries, and seek magical artifacts. If a faction loses all its heroes and its leader it is considered vanquished.
			<br>
			<table border="0">
			<tr><td>The game is turn-based, with each faction's turn progressing through the following phases:
			<ol><li>Politics (if activated)
			<li>Events
			<li>Diplomacy
			<li>Combat movement
			<li>Combat
			<li>Non-combat movement
			<li>Mercenaries and treasure
			<li>New unit recruitment
			<li>New unit placement
			<li>End of turn report</ol></td>
			<td><img src="army.png" align="right"/></td></tr></table>
			The map is divided into territories, each of which has a production value. At the end of each turn, a faction's income, measured in production units (PUs), is calculated based on these territory values. This income is primarily used to recruit new units. Territories can also have terrain, mercenary, and magic effects.
			<br>
			<br>Battle is initiated if after the combat movement phase a faction's units are in the same territory as an opposing faction's units. Battle is resolved by the roll of dice, with attacking and defending units scoring hits if they roll at or below their strength value. Attackers can withdraw from the battle, otherwise it progresses until only one faction's units remain, and that faction now takes control of the territory.
			<br>
			<br>Purchased units can only be placed in territories with a leader or hero. They cannot be placed in newly conquered territories; i.e., a hero cannot lead an attack and raise an army in the same turn, unless it retreats from the attack. The number of new units that can be placed in a territory is capped by that territory's production value. Any excess units are not lost, and will be available for future placement. New heroes, fortifications, and bowmen do not count against this limit, but only one of each can be placed in a territory per turn.
			<br>

			<br>
			<h1>3. Factions</h1>
			<center><img src="factions.png" align="middle"/></center>
			<br>
			There are ten factions, split into three alliances. Each faction has unique advantages and national objectives. The advantages are detailed below. The objectives, and the rewards for achieving them, are detailed in-game on the Objectives panel.
			<br>
			<br>By default the alliances are permanent. However, by enabling "Politics" in the options panel before launching the game, you can make alliances dynamic, allowing factions to make peace with age-old enemies and declare war on former allies. The result is a "free-for-all" game, although the length of any war or alliance may be affected by a faction's cultural and historical inclinations.
			<br>
			<br>If there are only two players, each can select an alliance to control and the remaining alliance can be disabled or assigned to the AI. If a quick game is desired, an Iuz vs. Furyondy contest is recommened, with all other factions disabled. (Note that disabling a faction may also disable any triggers or events related to that faction. An alternative is the "does nothing" AI.) 
			<br>
			<br><b>Important:</b> Players should be sure to select the in-game user action that identifies them as human players. This disables some of the limitations placed on AIs which are necessary to keep Greyhawk AI-compatible. Alternatively, this can be set using the options before launching the game.

			Just as no plan survives contact with the enemy, no strategy can disregard the caprice of chance.
			<br>
			<br>Beginning in the second round, each faction may experience random events. These vary in significance, they can have positive or negative effects, and they can be natural, like floods; or political, like rebellions; or military, like unforeseen allies that unlock new unit types.</td>
			<td><img src="time.png" align="right"/></td></tr></table>
			<h1>5. Diplomacy</h1>
			In addition to politics between the factions (if enabled), each faction can also exercise diplomatic options, attempting to bring neutral nations under their control through persuasion rather than violence. The chance for success depends on the cultural and historical inclinations of the neutral nation.
			<br>
			<br>Attempts at diplomacy cost PUs. The greater the value of the target nation, the greater the cost. On the other hand, the less likely they are to agree the fewer resources you invest in your embassy and the lower the cost. If you fail your PUs aren't entirely wasted--your chances will improve next turn. After you pay another bribe, of course.
			<br>
			<br>If successful, you gain control of the neutral territories and receive a number of units typical to that nation. These new units cannot move until your next turn. If some of that nation's territories were under enemy control, they remain under enemy control, although some of your new units may be placed there.
			<br>
			<br>Diplomacy is only possible if your leader or a hero unit is present in your capital. Capitals are indicated by each faction's coat arms. As the game progresses and war spreads, there will be fewer options for diplomacy.

			<br>
			<b>*Hit Points:</b>
			<br>Two-hit point units cannot be healed or repaired, with the exception of Furyondy's national advantage.
			<br>
			<br><b>*Terrain:</b>
			<br>Units with terrain attributes receive +1 to attack and defense when fighting in that terrain. They may also blitz (pass through and claim unguarded territories without stopping) those terrain types in addition to regular terrain. Also, land units receive a -1 penalty to attack when disembarking from ships. For cavalry this penalty increases to -2, although they may still charge as normal.
			<br>
			<br><b>*Cavalry charge:</b>
			<br>Cavalry units get one free attack at the start of battle. The attack is made at normal attack or defense strength and does not benefit from heroes or leaders. If a fortification is present, defending cavalry still receive a free attack, but attacking cavalry do not. If the cavalry outnumber potential targets, the number of free attacks is limited to the number of targets.
			<br>
			<br><b>*Blockade:</b>
			<br>A faction loses one PU for every enemy galley or brigantine in sea zones that border their territories. The loss is capped by the number of ships and the production value of the territories, whichever is lower.
			<br>
			<br><b>*Dragon abilities:</b>
			<ul><li>Dragons can raid heroes and leaders. Fear of the dragon reduces the hero's ability to raise armies (destroys PUs, capped per dragon at the production value of the territory).
			<li>They can be shot from the sky by a bowman or giant, or intercepted by another dragon.
			<li>Dragons conduct single-round air battles with other dragons preliminary to ground battles.
			<li>They can scramble from shore to defend ships within bordering sea territories or to attack enemy ships before they unload invading armies.
			<li>A full-sized galley can carry one dragon in addition to troops. A damaged galley cannot carry a dragon.
			<li>If the galley carrying a dragon is damaged, the dragon is forced to land in an adjoining allied territory, if possible.
			<li>If starting from the same territory, leaders and heroes can ride dragons, either into battle or during a non-combat move.
			<li>Dragons with riders cannot make bombing raids.
			<li>If a dragon is slain by a bowman, its rider immediately dies. If a dragon is slain in combat, its rider dies unless there are other allied units still remaining.
			<li>Dragons roll one die when defending, with a strength of 4 regardless of battle type.
			<li>Dragons roll two dice when attacking, and have an attack strength of 2 in air battles, 5 in ground and sea battles. This makes dragons devastating against ground units, but makes dragon-on-dragon aerial combat equal.
			<li>After battle, dragons must land on a friendly galley or a territory that began the turn under allied control. Dragons cannot control territory.
			<li>Dragons are very powerful. If your enemey has obtained them, you should quickly do so yourself, or at least acquire plenty of bowmen. Dragons (and giants) can be unlocked by events, but they are more likely to be unlocked by magical treasure.</ul>
			<br>
			<b>*Giant abilities:</b>
			<ul><li>In addition to their great strength in battle, by hurling a massive spear, wielding an enormous bow, or simply throwing a boulder, giants have a 2 in 6 chance of killing an enemy dragon when it raids or before a battle begins, whether attacking or defending.
			<li>If multiple giants or dragons are present, the lesser number limits the number of chances the giants get; e.g., one giant gets one total roll against two dragons, and three giants get one total roll against one dragon.</ul>
			<br>
			<b>*Bowman abilities:</b>
			<ul><li>The purpose of Bowmen is to defend against dragons, especially to defend leaders and heroes.
			<li>Bowmen cannot participate in normal combat but have a 1 in 6 chance of killing an enemy dragon when it raids or before a battle begins, whether attacking or defending.
			<li>If multiple bowmen or dragons are present, the lesser number limits the number of attacks the bowmen make. However, bowmen and giants are counted separately, and both can have a chance to kill the same dragon.</ul>
			<br>
			<b>*Leader and hero abilities:</b>
			<ul><li>Leaders increase the attack and defense strength of up to ten allied units by one (fifteen units for Nyrond).
			<li>Heroes increase the strength of up to five allied units by one (eight units for Nyrond).
			<li>These increases stack with fortification, but not with each other.
			<li>Leaders and heroes can recruit units, hire mercenaries, and seek treasure.
			<li>Only leaders can recruit new heroes. Only one hero can be added per turn, and it does not count against the normal recruitment limit.
			<li>A faction can only have one leader unit.
			<li>A faction can only replace its leader using a hero in a victory city.
			<li>A faction can revive a vanquished ally's leader in its own capital.
			<li>Leaders, heroes, and bowmen cannot fight battles on their own. Heroes and bowmen will simply be killed by the enemy army. Leaders will be killed if the enemy is another faction, or taken prisoner if the enemy is neutral.
			<li>Players must select the in-game user action (same dialog as Diplomacy) that identifies them as human players. Otherwise, their leaders, heroes, and bowmen will be unable to move during the combat movement phase.</ul>

			Certain territories bear this symbol, indicating mercenaries can be recruited there. The type of mercenary varies by faction and territory. 
			<br>
			<br>If a leader or hero is in a mercenary territory at the end of the non-combat movement phase, there is a 50% chance that faction will immediately recruit two mercenary units. This chance increases after every failure and decreases after every success. Thus a hero is unlikely to have many successes or failures in a row.
			<br>
			<br>A faction can have multiple chances by placing heroes in multiple mercenary territories, but only one chance per territory.
			<br>
			<br>Leaders and heroes in mercenary territories cannot raise regular armies; i.e., purchased units cannot be placed in mercenary territories, with the exception of fortifications and bowmen.
			<br>
			<br>Mercenaries are affected by fortifications, but don't receive bonuses from heroes or leaders.

			<tr><td><h1>8. Magical Treasure</h1></td>
			<td><img src="magic.png" align="right"/></td></tr></table>
			This symbol indicates that a leader or hero can go questing for magical treasure in this territory. These artifacts can be extremely powerful, but cannot be obtained without a fight, so a hero should not attempt this without the aid of supporting units. Even well-protected, there is always a small chance the hero (or leader) may fail and be slain in the attempt. Also note that the hero must participate in the battle--no units can enter the territory during non-combat movement.
			<br>
			<br>If the leader or hero survives, there is a chance they will acquire an artifact after the non-combat movement phase. This chance fluctuates around 50%, although it may be higher on the faction's first and second attempts of the game. It increases after every failure and decreases after every success. Thus a hero is unlikely to have many successes or failures in a row.
			<br>
			<br>Note that these territories are ungovernable and new monsters will spawn every round, meaning the hero will have to fight again if it doesn't move. Moreover, units can only move from these ungovernable territories back to allied territories, and only before combat. Otherwise they are trapped.
			<br>
			<br>Magical treasure can vary by faction but does not vary by territory. Treasure is almost always beneficial, and its impact can be major or minor, permanent or temporary. Note that, unlike mercenary territories, a faction can only benefit from one magical treasure territory per turn.
			<br>
			<br>Players must select the in-game user action (same dialog as Diplomacy) that identifies them as human players. Otherwise, their units will be unable to enter magical treasure territories.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h1>9. Victory</h1>
			A faction or alliance can claim victory if all others are vanquished. A faction is considered vanquished if it has lost its leader and all its heroes. Leaderless, its armies cannot be reinforced and are considered renegades, at war will all factions, even former allies. Note: If you leave your leader or last hero at sea, rumors that they have died will spread and you will be considered vanquished.

			<td>Victory conditions can also be set based on how many victory cities (VCs) are controlled by an alliance. Victory cities are identified by this symbol. Capitals count as two.</td></tr></table>
			<br>
			By default, Honorable Victory is selected. Other options, intended for shorter or longer games, include Projection of Power and Total Victory.

			<br>For an individual victory in a free-for-all game you should disable these victory conditions. Victory is then achieved by vanquishing all opponents, or you may track VCs manually. Suggested requirements: 10 VCs for a Projection of Power victory, 20 for an Honorable Victory, and 40 for a Total Victory.

			<h1>10. Tips and Known Issues</h1>
			<ul><li>Players should be sure to select the in-game user action that identifies them as human players. This disables some of the limitations placed on AIs which are necessary to keep Greyhawk AI-compatible. Alternatively, this can be set using the options before launching the game. 
			<li>The AI is functional in Greyhawk Wars, but does not utilize many of the game's features. To mitigate this, experienced players should give the AI a bonus income percentage in the options before launching the game. First-time players may want to give the Hard AI a negative income percentage penalty.
			<li>The time spent watching the AI move its units can be reduced under the Game menu by changing AI Pause Duration to 50 ms.
			<li>For better visual experience, map blends should be disabled. This can be done under the View menu by unchecking Show Map Blends. Map Details should be enabled.
			<li>Players receive chance notifications related to event checkers, mercenaries, and magic. These contain no useful information and can be disabled under the Game menu, under User Notifications, by unchecking Show Trigger/Condition Chance Roll Successful and Failure.
			<li><b>Known Issue:</b> The TripleA engine allows a defender to call on unallied, third-party dragons to scramble to help defend. For the purposes of Greyhawk Wars, this is against the rules.
			<li><b>Known Issue:</b> Regularly purchased units cannot be placed on mercenary territories. However, it is possible to place galleys and half-galleys using heroes in mercenary territories. This should be considered an exploit.
			<li><b>Known Issue:</b> A faction will incorrectly become vanquished if it boards its last remaining hero or leader onto a boat belonging to an ally. The allied boat and the hero or leader will then be stuck in an unresolvable conflict, with neither able to move from the territory.

			<br>Greyhawk, Dungeons & Dragons, etc., are the property of Wizards of the Coast (http://dnd.wizards.com/), which is not associated in any way with TripleA. 
			<br>
			<br>This project began as an attempt to emulate and share some nostalgia for an out-of-print tabletop game. It remains a celebration of Greyhawk, a world designed for the use of player-adventurers in creating their own stories.
